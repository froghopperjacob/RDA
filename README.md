# RDA ( Roblox Discord API )

RDA is a Async Class based program that allows interaction with the Discord API. With a customized redirect proxy RDA can recieve websocket events and be below HTTP Ratelimit.

## UserBots and SelfBots

Discord is currently prohibiting creation and usage of automated client accounts.
We do not support using Userbots and Selfbots for these reasons and support will not be added.
If you need a bot, use a bot account from the [Application Dashboard](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications).
